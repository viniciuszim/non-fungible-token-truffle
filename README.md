# Sample Truffle Project

This project demonstrates a basic Truffle use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
truffle help
truffle test
truffle migrate --network ganacheripts/deploy.ts
truffle migrate --network goerli
truffle run verify Spacebear --network goerli
```
